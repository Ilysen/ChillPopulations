		So here's how this works:
		There are several types of populations that we want to selectively exclude creatures from.
		- Mechanimist converts, Oboroqoru worshippers, and Yd Freehold residents (these are all considered 'converts' within the game's logic)
		- Villagers, including wardens
		- Hired guards of merchants
		- Psychic thralls of legendary Seekers
		- Sultan cultists

		The ExcludeFromDynamicEncounters tag in vanilla is unfortunately unsuitable here, because it's very general and would also prevent creatures from appearing in relevant population tables. As a result, to affect the game's functionality less, we use some more specific stuff instead:
		
		Villagers and converts check the ExcludeFromVillagePopulations tag, so we can apply that tag to block them from appearing in those places. Since it isn't easily patchable, this is just kind of accepted as a known issue. Sometimes you'll get weep wardens and stuff, ah well

		Hired guards can be prevented with the vanilla NoGuard tag. By default this is only present on dream wrens, but we can extend it to anything we want.

		Vanilla has no special logic to prevent thralls, but the method for selecting valid options is easily postfixable with Harmony. We use a new tag, Ava_ChillPopulations_NoThrall, to prevent monsters from appearing as thralls. NOTE: Creatures with a mental shield (such as robots and oozes) are already barred from being thralls, so it isn't necessary to apply the tag to them to do so.

		Sultan cultists are more complicated because the logic for selecting them is inline. Instead, we prevent the base method from running if the given blueprint has the Ava_ChillPopulations_NoCultist tag.
		
		~ ~ ~
		
		The design philosophy with all these changes is to prevent stuff that either strictly doesn't make narrative sense (dromad caravan guards staying the trader after they get turned into a thrall, for instance) OR stuff that causes significant mechanical disruption (mine-laying robots turning their home village into a deathtrap, and so on.) For a lot of that kind of thing, the game doesn't differentiate the creature being in a special role when using its behavior, so clonelings will still clone everything in sight, humors will drench the town in acid, and so on - these changes make up the vast majority of the roster.
		
		While a small handful of enemy types are excluded in their entirety from showing up in special roles, the lion's share are just prevented from showing up as hired guards or villagers due to the inability to easily turn off their special mechanics (or to have them not use those mechanics unless they're in combat.) Particularly disruptive things are also prevented from becoming pariahs and Seeker thralls. Almost everything can still be a sultan cultist.
